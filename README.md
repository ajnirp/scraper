* `xkcd.py` downloads the latest xkcd
* `insta.py <url>` downloads the instagram pic located at `<url>`
* `scraper.py <url>` downloads all images from a tistory
* `scraper-processes.py <url>` same as `scraper.py <url>`, but creates multiple processes instead of threads. Not much of a speedup.
* `rust-tistory-scraper` is the Python scraper ported to Rust.
